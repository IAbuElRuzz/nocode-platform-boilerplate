# No-Code Platform Boilerplate

Powerful Next.js boilerplate. Clone this repo and start your no-code platform today. The platform allows you to create REST API endpoints using a no-code editor. You can request the endpoint from any HTTP client. Additionally, the boilerplate provides a simple UI to test your endpoints. You can easily extend this template and add your own features.

This boilerplate uses:

* [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/)
* [Tailwindcss](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss)
* [ðŸŒ‡ Sequential Workflow Designer](https://github.com/nocode-js/sequential-workflow-designer)
* [ðŸšš Sequential Workflow Machine](https://github.com/nocode-js/sequential-workflow-machine)
* [â›½ Sequential Workflow Editor](https://github.com/nocode-js/sequential-workflow-editor)

The boilerplate supports two types of storage:

* `memory` - in-memory storage, used by default, for development purposes.
* `mongodb` - MongoDB storage, requires `MONGODB_URI` environment variable.

To choose storage type, set `STORAGE_TYPE` environment variable. You may do it by setting `.env` file:

```
STORAGE_TYPE=memory
```

or

```
STORAGE_TYPE=mongodb
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017
MONGODB_DB=nocodeApiBuilder
```

## ðŸš€ Deployment

To deploy this boilerplate, you need any compatible with Next.js hosting.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fnocode-js%2Fnocode-platform-boilerplate&project-name=nocode-platform&repository-name=nocode-platform&env=STORAGE_TYPE,MONGODB_URI)

To deploy this template to Vercel you need to set `STORAGE_TYPE=mongodb` and `MONGODB_URI` environment variables. The memory storage doesn't work with cloud hosting. We recommend to use [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) for database hosting.

## ðŸ”¨ Development

You can work with NPM but we recommend to use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/):
